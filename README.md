# LeetCode Solutions

## Overview
This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems, developed to enhance my algorithmic problem-solving skills. The solutions are implemented primarily in `Python 3.9.6`, focusing on clarity, efficiency, and best coding practices.

## Structure
The repository is organised into three main directories based on difficulty level:

- **`easy/`**: Solutions to easy-level problems.
- **`medium/`**: Solutions to medium-level problems.
- **`hard/`**: Solutions to hard-level problems.

Each solution is named according to the problem's unique identifier and title (e.g., `0001_two_sum.py`).

## Usage
To run a solution, execute:

```sh
python <difficulty-level>/<problem-file>.py
```
